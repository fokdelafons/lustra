# Frequently Asked Questions (Technical & Ethical)

## Governance & Mission

### Is Lustra a political party or movement?
**No.** Lustra is a neutral technological infrastructure. We provide the tools for citizens to organize, but we do not lead political agendas.

### Does Lustra tell users how to vote?
**No.** The "Context Sterilization" process removes opinions. We provide facts; users provide the judgment.

### Why is the code "Source Available" and not MIT/Apache?
To protect the ecosystem from corporate capture. The **PolyForm Noncommercial License** ensures that Big Tech cannot wrap our work into a paid SaaS product while allowing students, NGOs, and activists to use it freely.

## Technology & AI

### Why do you use AI if it hallucinates?
We use AI exclusively as a **transformation engine**, not a knowledge base.
1.  We feed the model the raw text (Ground Truth).
2.  We set `temperature=0` (Determinism).
3.  We enforce strict JSON schemas.
This pipeline reduces hallucination risk to near zero. Every summary links back to the official government PDF for verification.

### What is "Civic Parity"?
It is our design philosophy where citizen-drafted legislation (via **Civic Projects**) is displayed with the same visual weight and analytical rigor as government bills.

## Funding

### Who pays for the servers?
The community. Lustra relies on voluntary contributions (Stripe) and infrastructure grants (e.g., Google for Startups).

### Do you sell user data?
**Never.** We collect minimal data (Email/UID for anti-bot protection) and do not use trackers or sell behavioral profiles.
