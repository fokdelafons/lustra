# Lustra Governance Model

Lustra is maintained as a **Digital Public Infrastructure**. Unlike commercial startups optimized for profit, Lustra is optimized for mission integrity.

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities

### The Custodian (Legal Operator)
**FO&WO VENTURES SP. Z O.O.** acts as the legal custodian of the project assets (servers, domains, keys).
*   **Mandate:** To ensure financial sustainability and legal compliance.
*   **Constraint:** The Custodian operates on a non-dividend basis regarding Lustra. All revenues are reinvested into infrastructure.

### The Lead Architect (Benevolent Dictator)
Currently, **Jacek Michałowski** serves as the Lead Architect.
*   **Authority:** Final decision-making power on technical architecture, UI/UX direction, and AI methodology (Temperature 0.0 policy).
*   **Reasoning:** Rapid iteration requires decisive leadership in the early stages ("Wartime Mode").

### The Civic Board (Future Roadmap)
To protect the mission from "Founder Risk" (corruption, burnout, drift), a **Civic Board** will be established once the platform reaches [100k active users].
*   **Role:** Oversight and Veto power over changes to the core "AI Neutrality" protocols.
*   **Election:** Members elected by the verified user base.

## 2. Capture Resistance (The Safety Valves)

How do we ensure Lustra never sells out?

1.  **Source Available License (PolyForm):** Prevents hostile corporate forks. If Lustra ever becomes "evil", the community cannot be commercially exploited by a clone.
2.  **Radical Transparency:** AI prompts and logs are public. Any attempt to bias the algorithm is visible in the diffs.
3.  **The "Nuclear Option" (Community Fork):** If the Custodian betrays the mission, the community has the moral and technical right to fork the codebase (under non-commercial terms) and migrate to a new instance. We build infrastructure, not cages.

## 3. Funding & Integrity
*   **No Paywalls:** Access to legislation is a human right.
*   **No Ads:** We do not trade user attention.
*   **Sustainability:** Funded by voluntary donations and specific R&D grants.
